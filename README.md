# Redux Saga Shopping Cart Example
Took the shopping cart example from the [redux-saga repo](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/tree/master/examples/shopping-cart) and turned it into a standalone Node.js app with additional redux-saga functionality and features as well as major refactoring for ease of understanding.

__Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)(a better npm):__

Run `npm install -g yarn` to install Yarn globally if not done already

__Install all the dependencies:__

`yarn install`

__Then use one of the available scripts:__

In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`yarn test`

Runs all of your files under all \_\_test\_\_ directories as well as all files ending with `.test.js`

`yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
